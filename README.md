### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- You have got three full days, so try to reach as much perfection as possible for this challenge!
- Try to implement the design below, using only Nextjs and Tailwindcss,
- Adhere to the best practices Yannick showed you today,
- Use tailwind as much as possible. Only use custom CSS when you absolutely have to. In that case, structure your custom CSS in BEM.
- When you start the project, immediately create a "development" branch where you will do all your coding,
- When you are finished, create one large pull request (dev > main), which will then be reviewed by the code reviewer of your gym,

- After peer review your trello cards should go to code review by tech lead and Arsene or Maurice should be tagged.
